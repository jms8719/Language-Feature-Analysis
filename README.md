# Predicting-Amazon-Fresh-Foods-Ratings-With-Language-Feature-Analysis

In this CSE 158 assignment, our team
investigated Amazon Fine Foods reviews to
create a predictor for ratings. Through use of
linear regression, we created a supervised
learning model that demonstrated a correlation
between a set of textual features and review
ratings.
Our dataset consists of features such as the
reviewer’s rating, review text, review summary,
helpful votes and unhelpful votes on the review,
and the total number of votes associated with the
review. Additionally, we discovered that we
could apply language processing to obtain
advanced features which provided us with
excellent correlating features. Through use of
optimizations such as n-grams, regularization,
sentiment analysis, and rounding of edge cases,
we managed to improve upon the baseline
model.
We compare our model’s results with the
baseline model by using Mean Squared Error
(MSE) as the metric. The baseline resulted in an
MSE of 1.738211814923221 on the test set. Our
model resulted in an MSE of
0.8608320287972824 on the test set, an
improvement over the baseline by 50.475999449
percent.
